Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating documents on the web. Markdown is written in regular plain text with a few special characters for styling the document. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but markdown files are usually rendered in HTML by a Markdown parser which converts Markdown files into HTML.

Markdown is quickly becoming the writing standard for technical professionals, writers, scientists, academics, etc; because markdown files can easily be accessed across various devices and platforms.

Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

On GitHub markup is been used to style documents in places like:
*Gists
*Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
*Files with the .md or .markdown extension

## GitHub Flavored Markdown

GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com

### Username @mentions
Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”, because you’re mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization.

### Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
